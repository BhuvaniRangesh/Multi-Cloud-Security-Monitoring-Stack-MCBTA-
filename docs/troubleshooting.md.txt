# Troubleshooting Log

### Issue: SSH Connection Refused / Permission Denied
**Problem:** `Permission denied (publickey)` when attempting to SSH into the AWS EC2 instance.
**Cause:** 1. The `.pem` file had incorrect permissions (too open).
2. The local machine was trying to use a default key instead of the MCBTA key.

**Solution:**
1. Created a fresh RSA key pair in the AWS Console.
2. Downloaded the `.pem` file and restricted permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 mcbta-key.pem
